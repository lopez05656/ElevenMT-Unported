If you're building for Red Velvet Cake (Android 11):
Remove the Eleven line and Add this to your lineage.xml (It's located in /.repo/manifests/snippets): <project path="packages/apps/Eleven" name="lopez05656/ElevenMT-Unported" />

After you do that, you may issue the repo sync (Or repo sync --force-sync if you already synced your rom) command and you'll be all set.
